	d) Methods should interact with all objects in the calling chain

Q.2 What does a class with only public variables and no functions represent?

	a) An abstract interface with hidden implementation.
	b) A data structure or DTO used for simple data transfer.

Q.1 What is the recommended approach to minimise NullPointerException?

	a) Implement defensive null checks in all methods.
	b) Always catch NullPointerException at the top level of application.
	c) Avoid returning Null from methods and prefer using special case patterns or empty collections.
	d) None of these


Q.2 What is the primary advantage of using try-catch-finally block structure?

	a) It ensures that no errors occur during program execution
	b) It ensures the consistent program state.
	c) It completely eliminates the need for handling exceptions.
	d) It reduces the number of exceptions thrown by the program.
