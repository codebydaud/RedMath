Q.1 Which of the following best describes "intention-revealing names" in programming?

	a) Names that hide the purpose of variables and functions
	b) Names that are very short and concise
	c) Names that clearly communicate the intent of variables and functions
	d) Names that are difficult to pronounce


Q.2 What are the dangers of using disinformative names in programming?

	a) They make code easier to understand
	b) They can lead to misunderstandings and errors
	c) They improve collaboration among developers
	d) They have no impact on code quality

Q.3  what is the primary benefit of investing time in choosing meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes?

	a) It improves code execution speed
	b) It simplifies debugging by reducing code complexity
	c) It makes code easier to understand and maintain
	d) It minimizes the use of comments in the code

Q.4 Which practice is described as contributing to disinformation in variable names?

	a) Using descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose.
	b) Using number series for names like a1, a2, and aN.
	c) Using different names for variables of the same type in different scopes.
	d) Using common prefixes like temp or data for temporary variables.

Q.5 What should method names ideally include?
Answer: Verb or verb phrases

Q.6 Which of the following method names could potentially be improved for clarity?

	a) initializeSettings
	b) loadDataFromServer
	c) update
	d) sendRequestToServer

Q.1 What does the Law of Demeter suggest about method calls on objects?

	a) Methods should only interact with their own class's methods.
	b) Methods should extensively chain calls to enhance functionality.
	c) Methods should call functions on objects returned by other methods.
	d) Methods should interact with all objects in the calling chain

Q.2 What does a class with only public variables and no functions represent?

	a) An abstract interface with hidden implementation.
	b) A data structure or DTO used for simple data transfer.
	c) A fully encapsulated object with strict access control.s.
	d) An object-oriented class with complex internal logic.

Q.3 Which principle is violated if a method directly manipulates the internals of another object through multiple levels of method chaining? 
Answer : The Law of Demeter

Q.1 What is the recommended approach to minimise NullPointerException?

	a) Implement defensive null checks in all methods.
	b) Always catch NullPointerException at the top level of application.
	c) Avoid returning Null from methods and prefer using special case patterns or empty collections.
	d) None of these


Q.2 What is the primary advantage of using try-catch-finally block structure?

	a) It ensures that no errors occur during program execution
	b) It ensures the consistent program state.
	c) It completely eliminates the need for handling exceptions.
	d) It reduces the number of exceptions thrown by the program.
